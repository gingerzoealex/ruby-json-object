For this challenge I decided to give Ruby a go. To get up to speed I followed the documentation, starting with https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/ this tutorial. 

To install ruby:
`sudo apt-get install ruby-full`

To install dependency Gems:
`sudo apt-get install rest-client`

To run the program from the command line
`ruby ckan_data_store.rb`
